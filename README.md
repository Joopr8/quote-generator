# Description
This is a quote generator that was built whilst following the JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects course from ZTM (Zero to Mastery) community. It will fecth quotes from a JSON file and show a random quote. 

I added a new feature on the application that is de translation with the help of [MyMemory API](https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php)
